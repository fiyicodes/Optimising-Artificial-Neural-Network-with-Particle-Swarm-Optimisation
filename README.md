# Optimising-Artificial-Neural-Network-with-Particle-Swarm-Optimisation
This project explores optimizing an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to predict concrete compressive strength. PSO efficiently tunes hyperparameters like neurons and learning rate, improving prediction accuracy. The dataset includes cement, water, and aggregate composition.
